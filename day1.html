        <h5> Robot Go! </h5>
	<p> Our first challenge was to make the robot walk in a straight line.
	At first we came up with multiple ideas to tackle the challenge but then we realized that if we told the robot to move straight for about 12 seconds it completed the goal.

        <td bgcolor=#009CFF> Challenge #2 
	<p>Then, the second challenge was difficult because we had to make a serious of turns.
	First, it seemed like an impossible task because  we had a construction problem: our wheels were connected.
	This was a problem because in order for the robot to make a left turn the right wheel would 
	have to turn faster because of the greater distance it had to trave while
	the left wheel travels less of a dance.
	In the end, we fixed the problem and where able to complete the challenge. </p>
